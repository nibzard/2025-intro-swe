# Climate Analyzers - Alice Smith & Bob Johnson

**Project:** Climate Data Analysis
**Team:** Alice Smith & Bob Johnson
**Status:** In Progress

## üéØ Project Overview

Analyzing temperature trends using Python data science libraries to understand climate change patterns.

## üë• Team Information

- **Alice Smith** - GitHub: [@asmith](https://github.com/asmith)
- **Bob Johnson** - GitHub: [@bjohnson](https://github.com/bjohnson)
- **Team Name**: Climate Analyzers

## üõ† Technologies Used

- Python 3.9+
- pandas
- matplotlib
- numpy
- jupyter

## üöÄ Getting Started

### For Team Members

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone [your-fork-url]
   cd 2025-intro-swe/projects/climate-analyzers-asmith-bjohnson
   ```

2. **Set up your environment**:
   Use Codespaces or Devcontainer with local VS Code.

3. **Create your feature branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/[feature-name]
   ```

### For Instructors/Reviewers

1. View our project documentation below
2. Check our GitHub Issues for project planning
3. Review our Pull Requests for collaboration process

## üîÑ Pair Programming Workflow

### Daily Routine

1. **Start of Day (5 minutes)**
   - Sync with partner: Discuss goals and who's driving/navigating
   - Pull latest changes: `git pull origin main`
   - Create feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/[feature-name]`

2. **During Development**
   - **Driver**: Writes the code (types)
   - **Navigator**: Reviews code, thinks ahead, catches issues
   - **Switch roles** every 25-30 minutes (Pomodoro technique)
   - **Commit frequently** with descriptive messages

3. **End of Day (10 minutes)**
   - **Push your branch**: `git push origin feature/[feature-name]`
   - **Create Pull Request** to main branch
   - **Partner reviews** the PR (must be approved by both team members)
   - **Merge to main** after both approve

### Branch Strategy

- `main`: Protected branch for final, working code
- `feature/[feature-name]`: Individual feature branches
- All work happens on feature branches, never directly on main

### Pull Request Process

1. **Create PR** from feature branch to main
2. **Both team members must review** and approve
3. **Use the PR template** (see below)
4. **Merge only after** both approvals and CI passes

## üìù Pull Request Template

## What We Learned
- Brief reflection on what you learned today

## Next Steps
- What you plan to work on next
```

## üõ† Development Best Practices

### Communication
- **Think aloud** when you're the driver
- **Ask questions** when you're the navigator
- **Take breaks** together every hour
- **Be patient** and respectful of different coding styles

### Code Quality
- **Test your code** before committing
- **Write clear commit messages** following conventional commits
- **Review each other's code** carefully and constructively
- **Refactor together** when needed

### Problem Solving
- **Google together** - don't waste time being stuck
- **Draw diagrams** on paper or virtual whiteboard
- **Explain concepts** to each other
- **Ask for help** from instructors when needed

## ‚ùì Need Help?

- **Create a GitHub Issue** in the main repository
- **Ask during class** or office hours
- **Review GitHub documentation** for workflow questions
- **Check other team folders** for examples

**Remember**: The goal is to learn both technical skills AND collaboration skills. Communication and teamwork are just as important as the code you write!
