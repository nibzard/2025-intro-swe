Seat Review – A System for Evaluating Seating Comfort in Public Venues
1. Introduction

Public venues such as sports stadiums, theaters, concert halls, and arenas serve as gathering places where large numbers of people come together to share emotions, cultural experiences, entertainment, and a sense of belonging. Although attention is often primarily directed toward the main event—be it a sports match, theatrical performance, or concert—the overall visitor experience depends heavily on the quality of the venue’s environment, including accessibility, visibility, acoustics, and, importantly, seating comfort.

As more venues undergo modernization and digitalization, awareness of seating quality is becoming increasingly important. Comfortable seating influences not only the physical well-being of visitors, but also their likelihood of returning, purchasing season tickets, or recommending the venue to others.

The “Seat Review” project has been developed with the goal of enabling visitors to objectively evaluate the comfort of seats in various public venues. This creates a valuable database of user experiences. Based on these insights, venue managers can identify structural or maintenance-related issues and strategically improve the quality of their services.

2. Problem Description

Despite substantial investments in modern public venues, seating comfort is often overlooked or evaluated purely subjectively. Visitors frequently encounter a variety of issues, such as:

Non-ergonomic seat design – insufficient back support, limited legroom, or uncomfortable seat angles.

Damaged or unclean seats – caused by extensive use or inadequate maintenance.

Poor visibility – resulting from suboptimal seat positioning, insufficient elevation, or obstructed views.

Lack of a feedback system – visitors have no direct way to report their seating experience.

Inconsistent standards across sections – for example, premium and regular seating differing significantly in comfort without transparent justification.

Currently, there is no systematic method for collecting and analyzing data related to seating comfort in stadiums, theaters, or other venues. Existing reviews typically focus on atmosphere, acoustics, safety, or accessibility, while the physical comfort of seats remains underrepresented.

This highlights the need for a platform that enables objective evaluation of seating comfort across various venue types — not only to improve the general visitor experience, but also to help facility managers make data-driven decisions.

3. Hypothesis

The central hypothesis of the project is:

If visitors are provided with an easy-to-use system for evaluating seating comfort, their overall satisfaction will increase, and venue managers will be able to make targeted improvements to the design and functionality of their seating areas.

Additional sub-hypotheses:

Systematic collection of seating-comfort data will allow meaningful comparisons between different types of venues based on real user experiences.

Analysis of reviews will reveal the most common issues (e.g., insufficient legroom, worn-out cushions, poor visibility).

Positive seating experiences will enhance visitor loyalty and increase their likelihood of returning to the venue more frequently.
