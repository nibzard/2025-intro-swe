Your role is to design and describe a configuration page (initial setup page)
that guides the user through the entire setup process STEP BY STEP (wizard-style).

The goal of this page is:
- to allow users with no technical knowledge to complete the full configuration
- to ensure that no required step can be skipped
- to clearly show users where they are in the process and what comes next at all times

GENERAL STRUCTURE:
- The configuration page must be divided into clearly numbered steps (Step 1, Step 2, Step 3, etc.)
- Display a progress indicator (e.g., progress bar or step list with statuses: completed / active / upcoming)
- Allow moving to the next step only after all required fields are valid
- Allow returning to previous steps without losing entered data

FOR EACH STEP, YOU MUST DEFINE:
1. Step name (clear, simple, no technical jargon)
2. A short description of the purpose of the step (1–2 sentences)
3. A precise list of input fields:
   - field type (text, dropdown, checkbox, radio button, toggle, file upload, etc.)
   - whether the field is required or optional
   - placeholder text or example input
4. Validation rules (what is allowed / what is not)
5. Tooltip or helper text for complex fields
6. Default values (if applicable)
7. Error messages (clear and user-friendly)

USER EXPERIENCE (UX) REQUIREMENTS:
- Each step must include:
  - a "Next" button
  - a "Back" button (except on the first step)
- Disable the "Next" button until all required fields are valid
- Display inline validation errors below the fields, not as pop-ups
- Use human-friendly, encouraging language (e.g., "Let’s start by setting up the basics")

LOGIC AND FLOW:
- Support conditional steps (e.g., if the user selects option A, additional fields or a new step appear)
- Automatically save configuration state (auto-save)
- Provide a "Save & Exit" option

FINAL STEP (SUMMARY & CONFIRMATION):
- Display a summary of all entered data, grouped by sections
- Allow clicking "Edit" on each section to jump back to that step
- Display a "Confirm & Finish" button
- After confirmation:
  - show a success screen
  - explain what happens next (e.g., "Setup is complete. You can now start using the application.")

ADDITIONAL GUIDELINES:
- Tailor all copy for beginners (avoid technical terminology)
- Assume this is the user's first time using the system
- Focus on clarity, simplicity, and strong user guidance
- Communication tone: professional, friendly, and reassuring

At the end, provide:
- the complete step sequence
- a brief explanation of why this step-by-step flow is optimal for the user experience
